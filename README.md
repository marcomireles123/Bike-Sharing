# bikesharing
* Use tableau to create detailed data visualizations for a bike-sharing business proposal.

## Overview
In this project I created visualizations with Tableau to present past data of a bike-share company in NYC. With these data visuals, potential investors would be motivated to finance a startup bike-share company based in Iowa.

* My Tableau presentation can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/marco7241/viz/CitibikeAnalysis_16716858522550/Story1).

## Results
* The first visualization I started with was where the bike trips started for each user. With this graph, investors can tell which areas have the highest and lowest amounts of trips. This leads to maintaining the bikes in these areas as a priority since they will be used the most. We can also see a trend here. It appears the heaviest usage comes from areas that have a lot of tourists. This makes sense since the bikes provide tourists with a quick and cheap mode of transportation to travel the city during their stay.

* This one is a simple breakdown of the genders of all users. This information can help foster ideas to be able to include more women to even out the users in altogether.

* With the Trip hours visual, investors can see when the most amount of users are using the bike-sharing app. This way we can determine when we can take bikes in for maintenance, so that they can be prepared for the 'rush hour'.

* In users breakdown investors can see the genders of all users as well as whether they are a customer or a subscriber. We can determine total subscriber amount and if they are below expectations, an incentive program can be created for existing customers to convert into subscriber instead.

* According to this graph, we can determine that both genders have the heaviest usage around the same times. Females have a lighter gradient than the male group, but that is due females using the bike-sharing app less.

* This graph better represents the disparity between how many more males (orange line) there are than females (blue line).

* Finally this graph shows the duration of each trip and it appears that most of them are just under half an hour, without very many lasting more than an hour at all.

## Summary
* With these created visuals from the CitiBike dataset, it is easy to tell that they were successful in the hustling and bussling city of New York City. The tourists that vist the city were also a contributing factor to the success. It also appears that most rides average about half an hour off activity, so it should be taken into consideration that a radius of that time should be concentrated on since it trips would likely start and end in that area. 
* Here are some things to consider as well: 
  
:white_check_mark: Car ownership: How many residents in the area rely on their own personal vehicles to get from place to place and which residents rely on public transport or their own bikes to get around. Investors should not invest in an area where most things are spread out, because chances are that riders would not want to ride for that long or far to get to that destination.
