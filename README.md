# bikesharing
Use tableau to create detailed data visualizations for a bike-sharing business proposal.

## Overview
In this project I created visualizations with Tableau to present past data of a bike-share company in NYC. With these data visuals, potential investors would be motivated to finance a startup bike-share company based in Iowa.

My Tableau presentation can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/marco7241/viz/CitibikeAnalysis_16716858522550/Story1).

## Results
The first visualization I started with was where the bike trips started for each user. With this graph, investors can tell which areas have the highest and lowest amounts of trips. This leads to maintaining the bikes in these areas as a priority since they will be used the most. We can also see a trend here. It appears the heaviest usage comes from areas that have a lot of tourists. This makes sense since the bikes provide tourists with a quick and cheap mode of transportation to travel the city during their stay.
